# Brain Tumor Classification

## Overview
This project is a **Brain Tumor Classification** system built using **EfficientNetB0** for MRI image analysis. The deep learning model can classify Brain MRI scans into four categories:

- **Glioma Tumor**
- **Meningioma Tumor**
- **No Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**

The project features a **Streamlit-based web interface** where users can upload an MRI image, receive an instant prediction, and view confidence scores as a bar graph.
